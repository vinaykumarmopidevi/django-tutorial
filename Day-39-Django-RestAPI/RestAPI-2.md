# RestAPI

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It stands for Representational State Transfer. Here’s a breakdown:

- **Representational**: The data exchanged between the client and server is typically represented in a standard format like JSON or XML.
- **State**: REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary for the server to understand and fulfill it. The server doesn’t store information about the client's state between requests.
- **Transfer**: Data is transferred over HTTP using standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

Key features of RESTful APIs include:

1. **Resources**: Everything is treated as a resource, identified by a unique URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). For example, in a blog API, a blog post might be a resource with a URI like `/posts/123`.
2. **HTTP Methods**: CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are mapped to HTTP methods: GET (Read), POST (Create), PUT/PATCH (Update), DELETE (Delete).
3. **Stateless**: Each request from a client contains all the information needed for the server to fulfill it, without relying on previous interactions.
4. **Response Formats**: Data is typically exchanged in standardized formats like JSON or XML, although JSON has become more common due to its simplicity and readability.
5. **Hypermedia**: REST APIs can include hypermedia links in responses to guide clients on available actions, though this is not always strictly adhered to in practice.

RESTful APIs are widely used for building web services and are known for their scalability, simplicity, and compatibility with different platforms and languages.
