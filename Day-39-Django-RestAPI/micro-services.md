Microservices architecture is an approach to software development where an application is divided into smaller, independent services that are focused on specific business capabilities. Each microservice is a self-contained unit that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. 

Key characteristics of microservices include:

1. **Modularity**: Microservices are designed as small, independent components that perform a specific business function. Each service is responsible for a single concern, such as user authentication, order processing, or data storage.

2. **Independence**: Microservices operate independently of each other, with their own codebase, database, and deployment process. This allows teams to develop, test, deploy, and scale each service independently, without impacting other parts of the system.

3. **Decentralization**: Microservices encourage decentralization of decision-making and control. Development teams are typically organized around specific services, and each team has the autonomy to choose the technologies, tools, and frameworks that best suit their service.

4. **Resilience**: Because microservices are independent and isolated from each other, failures in one service do not necessarily affect the entire system. Applications built using microservices architecture are often more resilient and fault-tolerant.

5. **Scalability**: Microservices can be scaled independently based on demand. Services experiencing high traffic can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances, while services with lower demand can remain unchanged, optimizing resource utilization.

6. **Polyglotism**: Microservices allow for the use of different programming languages, frameworks, and databases within the same application. Each service can be implemented using the most suitable technology for its requirements, promoting flexibility and innovation.

Microservices architecture is often contrasted with monolithic architecture, where an application is developed as a single, tightly-coupled unit. While monolithic architecture can be simpler to develop initially, it can become challenging to maintain and scale as the application grows in size and complexity. Microservices offer greater flexibility, scalability, and agility, making them popular for building large-scale, distributed systems in modern software development.
