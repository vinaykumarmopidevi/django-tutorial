REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It's a style of software architecture that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services. 

In simpler terms, a RESTful API is an interface for interacting with web resources using the HTTP protocol. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet. REST APIs are commonly used for building web services that are scalable, flexible, and can be easily consumed by a variety of clients, including web browsers, mobile devices, and other applications.

Key principles of RESTful APIs include:

1. **Client-Server Architecture**: Separation of concerns between the client and the server.
2. **Statelessness**: Each request from a client must contain all the necessary information for the server to fulfill the request, and the server doesn't store any client state between requests.
3. **Uniform Interface**: A consistent way to interact with resources via standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
4. **Cacheability**: Responses from the server can be cached to improve performance.
5. **Layered System**: Clients interact with a layered architecture, where they are unaware of the inner workings of the server.
6. **Code on Demand (Optional)**: The server can send executable code to the client, such as JavaScript, to extend functionality dynamically (though this is not a required constraint).

RESTful APIs are widely used in web development because of their simplicity, scalability, and compatibility with the HTTP protocol, which is the backbone of the World Wide Web. They are often used for building web services, mobile backend services, and IoT (Internet of Things) applications, among others.
