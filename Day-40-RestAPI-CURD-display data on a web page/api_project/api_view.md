In Django, `@api_view` is a decorator provided by the Django REST Framework (DRF) that is used to define views that are intended to be used with RESTful APIs. 

Here's how it's typically used:

1. **Importing**: You need to import `api_view` decorator from `rest_framework.decorators` module.

```python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
```

2. **Decorating View Functions**: You can decorate your function-based views with `@api_view` decorator. This decorator provides behavior such as request parsing and response rendering suitable for APIs.

```python
@api_view(['GET', 'POST'])
def my_view(request):
    if request.method == 'GET':
        # handle GET request
    elif request.method == 'POST':
        # handle POST request
```

3. **HTTP Methods**: The `@api_view` decorator takes an optional argument specifying which HTTP methods the view should respond to. If not specified, it will respond to all methods.

4. **Request and Response Handling**: The `@api_view` decorator also handles request parsing and response rendering based on the request content type and the accept header in the request.

Here's a brief overview of the arguments you can pass to `@api_view`:

- `allowed_methods`: A list of HTTP methods that the view should respond to.
- `renderer_classes`: A list of renderer classes that should be used to render the response.
- `parser_classes`: A list of parser classes that should be used to parse the incoming request.
- `authentication_classes`: A list of authentication classes that should be used to authenticate the incoming request.
- `permission_classes`: A list of permission classes that should be used to check permissions on the incoming request.

By using `@api_view`, you can easily create API views in Django that follow the principles of RESTful design and leverage the features provided by Django REST Framework.
